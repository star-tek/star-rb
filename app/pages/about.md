<p>
We're a group of web developing hipsters and misfits, who are interested in the Ruby programming language. 
This is a group that ranges from novice to greybeard and everything in between. It's a great group to share 
your greatest technological feats with, but also a great place to get your coding career started. We have great 
presentations showcasing the up and coming Ruby Gems, the best testing practices, Agile development techniques, 
tricks of the software gurus and more. We're building a community that focuses on the fun in software development.
