Well it looks like our [first meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Star-rb/events/184727032/) 
was a success!  Four people showed up.  While it may seem small, this seems like a great start to me!  

### CoLab's TechWorking Event

I started the night off at the [Grandin Colab](http://www.grandincolab.com/)'s 
[TechWorking](http://www.meetup.com/RoanokeStartUp/events/183435982/) event, which was geared towards the tech scene
in Blacksburg and Roanoke.  At the last minute, I moved the location of our meetup from Salem to Grandin because I had 
a feeling that I'd network at TechWorkers and could rally some troops there who were interested in Ruby and AngularJS.

Turns out, *I was right!*

### What is a Star.rb meetup like?

So after some engaging conversation at TechWorkers, our meetup met at CUPS at 7:00pm.  We spent the time getting to
know each other, trading tips and tricks of the trade.  

Chase discussed the similarities and differences between 
**Rails** and **PHP frameworks**.  I talked about using **Ember** on my current project for work and overcoming some
common issues with **ember-data**.  I also spoke briefly about using **Lineman** on an **Angular** project.  Sean, who 
I met at **TechWorking**, discussed how using **Grunt** to automate frontend tasks has saved him a lot of time.  Habeeb,
a sharp young guy who drove all the way out from Bedford, wowwed us all with his **Tmux** configuration.

### We have a grand plan!

Our first few informal meetups will combine Star.rb and ng-star and this will 
continue until each group has their first *official* meetup.  We're calling these small meetups **Sidechannels**, 
because they're small events on the side.  Also, a sidechannel is a bit of cryptography trivia, for those in the know.  

Our meetup group encourages members to host Sidechannels of their own.  These events will be sanctioned and 
advertised on **Meetup.com**.  This should help us grow.  There are several areas within an hour of Roanoke that are 
just too small to develop large meetup groups of their own: Lynchburg, Staunton, etc.  Blacksburg has an very active 
tech community.  But an hour may be too far for some to travel, so having these small events on the side encourages 
members to stay active and further involvement in their area.  It should also help us identify the untitled leaders 
in our meetup group.

### Here's is our [next meetup event](http://www.meetup.com/Star-rb/events/187458672/).

## See you soon!
