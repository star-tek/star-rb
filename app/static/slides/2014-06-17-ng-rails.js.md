%% Here we go...

!SLIDE slide x=-1000 y=-2000

AngularJS + Rails = ng-rails

!SLIDE slide x=0 y=-2000

But first - **Why Lineman?**

!SLIDE slide x=1000 y=-2000

"Lineman takes **everything you love** about building server-side applications
so that you can **find joy in your client-side applications**"

!SLIDE x=0 y=-500 scale=4

IMO, javascript is good at doing javascript things.
Grunt & Bower are great on the frontend.  *Source maps*
are nice too.

!SLIDE x=850 y=6000 rotate=90 scale=5

In Rails, if you look at the asset pipeline's structure,
you'll notice how it mimics the app folder.

!SLIDE x=3500 y=5000 rotate=180 scale=6

But really, those two concerns should be separated.
IMO, Rails just isn't great at managing frontend assets.

!SLIDE x=2825 y=2325 z=-3000 rotate=300 scale=1

Using a single-page AngularJS app and API-only Rails.  Lineman
is perfect for separating these concerns.

!SLIDE x=3500 y=-1850 rotate=270 scale=6

Appistack has these loaded via gitmodules, which are easily substitued.
I could sub in a Clojure API if I wanted to.  Easy.

!SLIDE x=6700 y=-1500 scale=6

With the Rails-Lineman gem, they not 100% independent, but
the project is more convenient this way.  And much easier
to deploy to Heroku.

!SLIDE x=6300 y=2000 rotate=20 scale=1

The Rails API has Devise, Resque, Minitest & Capybara set up.
It's pretty vanilla.  Rails serves the index page.

!SLIDE x=6000 y=4000 scale=2

I had to make some changes to get the integration tests working.
Set up helpers to update the links in test environment.  Lineman
expects you to use JS testing tools.

!SLIDE x=6200 y=4300 z=-100 rotate-x=-40 rotate-y=10 scale=2

In LinemanJS, I've set up Angular/UI, Bower, UI-Bootstrap, Font Awesome.
The App basically has a signup/login modals, a navbar widget and a few pages.

!SLIDE x=7000 y=1500 scale=10

Frontend Problems I resolved: 

- Webfonts & Font Awesome
- ngRoute/ui.router
- Serving assets in test suite
- Containerizing Lineman for multiple environments - CORS/apiUrl
- Compiling Jade templates with Lineman

!SLIDE x=9000 y=0 scale=5

Other Problems:

- Which app should run integration testing?
- Decoupling the Client & API

!SLIDE x=11000 y=1500 scale=1

Features I'm adding next:

- Doorkeeper OAuth
- Users/Roles
- ResqueMailer/DeviseAsync
- Connecting a Android template

%% The End
